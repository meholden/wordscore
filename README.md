/* From a photo on facebook:
	if a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
	equals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 26
	search a dictionary file for words that add up to 100.
	  attitude=100
	  knowledge=96
	  hardwork=98
	dictionary file came from here: http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/ (also zip file is included)
	The rest of the code is original.

Files: main.c is the program, and all you need is this and the word list file
       Other files are for Dev-cpp compiler project, and documentation for the dictionary I used.
	   perfectwords.txt is the list of words that add up to 100
